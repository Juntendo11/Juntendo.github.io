#WSL setup

WSL setting was done in windows 10 Home environment running Ubuntu 22.04.
This was tricky to set up at the start as virtual environment had to be configured for windows linux subsystem and OS settings.
CPU virtualization had to be configured in the OS which was in the VT-m inside Gigabyte OS.

After getting these configured, the wsl 2 run successfully and ubuntu installment proceeded successfully.
Docker Desktop was successfully setup as well with account setup and json configuration.
