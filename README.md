# Juntendo Blog

Welcome to my blog where I post my personal findings as a diary record,
generally regarding with computer vision and 3DCG.

# Bit about myself.
- Electrical engineering at University of Queensland
- Electronics and 3DCG hobbyist
- I like good art


# Interest
<u> 3D modelling and animation. <u>
Here is Linie from "Sousou no Frieren" that I modelled and rendered!

<u> Graphics Shader<u>
And graphics shaders like OpenGL. Here's my 3D engine that I wrote in C++ and OpenGL. Wow video embed! So cool!!

Passionate about combining electronics engineering with 3DCG!
Motion captures are pre cool imo!

This one has tensorflow lite built in on a ESP32! Machine learning on $4 microcontroller? can u believe it? I love ESP32 :D



Used to build high voltage devices like tesla coil back in the days. I almost killed myself few times so I stopped XD
