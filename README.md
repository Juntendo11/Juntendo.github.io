# Juntendo Blog

Welcome to my blog where I post my personal findings as a diary record,
generally regarding with computer vision and 3DCG.

Bit about myself.
- Electrical engineering at University of Queensland
- Electronics and 3DCG hobbyist
- I like good art.


Im interested in 3D scanning/ printing,
3D modelling and animation.
Here is Linie from Sousou no Frieren that I modelled and rendered!

And graphics shaders like OpenGL.


Passionate about combining electronics engineering with 3DCG!
Motion captures are pre cool!

This one has tensorflow lite built in on a ESP32! 



Used to build high voltage devices like tesla coil back in the days :D
